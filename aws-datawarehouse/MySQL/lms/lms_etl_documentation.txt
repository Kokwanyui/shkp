A. Processes to update LMS data
1) Ask RMCR for lms data by email (around monthly 7-9th), 2 excel files will be received:
    i. `Retail Sales.xlsx`
    ii. `Mapping Table.xlsx`
2) Update 02.bi_dimension.dim_retail_sales_from_lms with `Retail Sales.xlsx` & script: MYSQL/lms/dim_retail_sales_from_lms.sql
3) Cleaning Data in `Mapping Table.xlsx`
4) Update 02.bi_dimension.dim_retail_sales_from_lms with Process 3 result &
5) Manually start Glue Job `tpdt_lms_retail_sales`


B. Working Folders
 - `Retail Sales.xlsx`: \\shknapsvm03\lrmcr\Common\RMCR\Analytics Team\Project\LMS record\Reatil Sales Record


C. Process Detail
Process 1:
`Retail Sales.xlsx` contain 3 months lms sales from shops.
Usually, there is T-2 months data. ie. you receive March 2022 LMS sales in May 2022 email.
It is because shops take 1 month to handle sales data and send back to us.
Sometimes, a few shops may not hand in sales data in time and, therefore, we need to delete last 2 months records and insert updated data again

Process 2:

Process 3:
i. Create New Excel
ii. Copy Mapping tab from past excel
iii. Copy `Mapping Table.xlsx` to `from RMCR` tab
iv. first cleaning:
    - Ctrl + F: Replace '(blank)' with '' to all columns
    - Ctrl + F: Replace "'" with "^" to column C to G
v. copy 02.bi_dimension.dim_lms_mapping to tab `past records`
vi. refresh formula in column S to Z
